### Hello from beautiful Placitas, New Mexico! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer (among other interests, see below), with many decades of experience.

All of my repositories are through my open source organization [Connective C++](https://github.com/connectivecpp).

This is the view from our house in New Mexico. We (my wife and I) love sunsets and most evenings are gorgeous through our front windows.
