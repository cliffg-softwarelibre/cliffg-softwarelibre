### Hello from beautiful Placitas, New Mexico! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer (among other interests, see below), with many decades of experience.

All of my repositories are through my open source organization [Connective C++](https://github.com/connectivecpp/). This includes a repository for various presentations I've made, including (unit tested) example code: [My Presentations](https://github.com/connectivecpp/presentations/)

I live in a town named Placitas, which is approximately 10 miles north of Albuquerque, New Mexico. I also lived over 30 years near Seattle in the state of Washington.

My current technical activities include co-organizing, presenting, and mentoring with the [New Mexico C++ Programmers](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers/) Meetup Group, attending and presenting at the [Albuquerque Google Developers Group](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-albuquerque/) and designing and coding various open source projects. I also perform consulting, training, and am working on an educational YouTube channel.

After moving to New Mexico I became a partner in an aviation company named [Merlin Aviation](https://merlinavation.net). We offer glider rides, training, and rentals (and hope to do the same with powered flight in the near future).

This is the view from our house in New Mexico. We (my wife and I) love sunsets and most evenings are gorgeous through our front windows.
